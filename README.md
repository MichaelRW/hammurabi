# hammurabi
Hammurabi is a text-based resource management game that has its origins as early as 1968.
Players are tasked to manage their food, land, and population in order to survive a 10-year run as King
Hammurabi without being overthrown or losing all of your population. The game got its replay value
from being incredibly challenging and we tried to recreate that as much as possible.


The game runs in both C++ and Haskell. 
For c++:
Simply compile and run “source.cpp” and it should run just fine. 

For Haskell:
The Haskell file is called Hammu.hs, and if it doesn’t automatically run simply enter main and it will run the game.
